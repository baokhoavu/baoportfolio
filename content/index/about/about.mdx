Full stack developer with lead dev experience creating fundraising campaigns, single page websites, interactive dashboards, and scripting solutions.

Having over 3 years of experience from working in a non-profit digital marketing agency, I've developed and intergrated many Cloud based Management Softwares by using with their middleware rendering services, email development capabilities, and database rendering/reports to synchronize with full stack web apps using vanilla and modern scripting.
