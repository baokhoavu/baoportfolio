Baolog is a Next.Js headless WordPress Website using GraphQL for complex data binding. Using Next.js to build the layout and WordPress as a data source, created posts housed on the CMS and can be queried using GraphQL instead of WordPress' API for a more defined and structured call. Layout and styles are applied using tailwind with responsive design across breakpoints.
